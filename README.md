# stong3_fMRI_processing_and_atlas_extraction

The goal of this project will be to use a subset of an open fMRI dataset (Prevent-AD) to create a tutorial in the form of
a Jupiter notebook, to pre-process fMRI data using fMRIPrep. The project will also use Nilearn to extract functional
connectivity atlases. All these operations will be done on an HPC server (i.e. Beluga) using Slurm Job submission.
