    "# MNC to BIDS conversion - First Brain Hack School Project\n",
    "## A step-by-step tutorial\n",
    "________________\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial was initially to generate functional connectivity matrices from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) starting from mnc images. The aim was to first convert the .mnc images in BIDS format. Then, to use fMRIPrep to pre-process the data and use the Nilearn package to extract connectivity matrices from the pre-processed images using different brain parcellations. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project was to be executed with data from the PREVENT-AD, a dataset of participants at risk of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), available openly on the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform. We wanted to use fMRI data from 10 participants at two different timepoints, at their baseline visit and at their 12 months visit, to obtain two functional connectivity matrices per participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as can be seen below, this project could not be completed. A Jupyter notebook describing how to pre-process the data from a bids dataset is included in this repository.\n",

    "The data used for this project is taken from the Prevent-AD cohort, the data for which is part of the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (CONP). The data is accessible [here](https://portal.conp.ca/dataset?id=projects/preventad-open). Note that an account is required for accessing the data. You can gain access by filling the form [here](https://openpreventad.loris.ca/). If you are using your own dataset with fMRIPrep, you can skip ahead to section 2.0 of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can refer to the instructions on the CONP/Prevent-AD for how to download the data. Note that you will require the following to be able to install the dataset on your workstation:\n",
    "- Datalad (you can install Datalad from this [link](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html)\n",
    "- Git-annex (you can install Git-Annex from this [link](https://git-annex.branchable.com/install/)\n",
    "- Homebrew (in the case where you can't install Git-annex with Conda and you use a Mac, as was my case, you can install it using Homebrew. You can install Homebrew from this [link](https://brew.sh/)\n",
    "\n",
    "With Datalad, you gain access to the full dataset through symbolic links. This means that you will have access to the folders and be able to see what you can download before downloading any actual data. You will need to enter your credentials for the Open PREVENT-AD initiative to download and work with anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Be careful:** Note that the full dataset is quite heavy (170.89GB). Datalad gives an option to download all subjects, but only subjects/sessions of interest should be downloaded.\n",
